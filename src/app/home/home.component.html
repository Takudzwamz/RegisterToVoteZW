        <p class="justify-content-center">
          Due to my ambitious and self-driven character, I do stand in many
          pedestals wearing different hats. I strongly believe in living a
          principled life, that directly marks a solid positive impact in the
          world. My desire is to sit at a round table deciding on the betterment
          of our tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that I am a vehicle of change and I am equipped with many
          different abilities to spread the contagious positivity rooted in me.
          Being born in a third world country is not a barrier, I was born to
          make a difference and to make the world a better place. I’m determined
          to inspire people who are buried on the other side of hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          My everyday motivation comes from my belief that, if the world can’t
          offer me on a silver platter, how about I create my own salvation. I
          believe everyone was destined for greatness, but it only depends on
          how far you’re willing to go and how much knowledge you’re willing to
          acquire along the way (Knowledge is Power).

            At Polignotic, I also worked as an English teacher and I was in
            charge of the speaking club as well. My oldest student was 56 and
            that was such a wonderful experience for me.
