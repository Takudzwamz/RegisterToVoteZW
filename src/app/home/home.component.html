          <h2>Why votingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 1.2rem">
            The  Constitution grants all Zimbabwean citizens aged 18 and older the right to vote,
            but the question often asked is whether voting will really make a difference.
            
            Of course it does! Voting gives you an opportunity to be part of decision-making that affects your life and the future
            of our country. If you don't vote, others will make the decisions for you.
            
            History shows that democracies in danger of losing their freedom register frighteningly low voter turnouts. In thriving
            democracies, people vote in large numbers and the people's voice remains supreme.

        <p class="text-center">
          You may take your right to vote and all other rights in our constitution for granted, but 41 years ago most of the
          people in our country were not allowed to vote. Many of them were arrested and jailed for demanding this most basic
          human right. Others were tortured and killed. Because of their sacrifice, today you can vote simply by presenting
          yourself at a voting station with your ID during a registration event that puts you on the voters' roll for life, and
          lets you vote in every future general and by-election in your area.

          generations. Voting is your chance to stand up for the issues you care about. This is your life: take the time to help
          decide what's best. Voting - rather than just venting on social media or protesting ‚Äì is the best way to make your voice
          heard and make a positive input on the issues that concern you.

        <h3 class="head-bar"><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Why it is important to register to vote</h3>
        <p class="justify-content-center">
          An individual‚Äôs right to vote ties that person to our social order, even if that person chooses not to exercise that
          right. Voting represents the beginning; everything else in our democracy follows the right to vote. Participation is
          more than just a value. It is a foundational virtue of our democracy. 
        </p>
        <p>To make your voice heard on an issue or candidate; don‚Äôt let others decide for you. Substantive representation of youth:
        The assumption is that voting will affect the nature of representation and ultimately the content of public policy. If
        young people do not register to vote and participate in elections, their distinct interests are more likely to be
        ignored or neglected by policy-makers.</p>
        <p>Every vote does count! Remember: there is power in numbers. When we vote and get our family members to vote, we can
        impact outcomes and change the debate. Zimbabwe‚Äôs youth represent over 60% of the population and about 44% of the total
        voters‚Äô roll. Young people should vote to ensure high overall turnout.</p>
        <p>
          Political integration strengthens democracy; political integration of the youth promotes public oversight, public order
          and democratic stability as long as young people are given a real voice, their vote is seen as meaningful and
          influential.
          
          
        </p>
        <p>Don‚Äôt let others decide for you; if you don‚Äôt vote, you‚Äôre letting others decide who wins and what issues matter.
        Today‚Äôs non-voters benefit from government and social services (like access to health care, spending on education,
        income inequality or public safety).</p>

            It was a Montessori School and that worked as an introduction to the
            Montessori system. Being a teacher, I learnt a lot of different
            methods in teaching and better ways to develop a mutual relationship
            between a teacher and students.
